	<p>Hi there! My name is Ally.  I'm 24 years old and I live in a small farming
	community in southeast Michigan. In my free time, I enjoy completing DIY projects,
	blogging, and spending time with my fiancee and our two cats.  I also love all things Disney!
	I worked there for two years and ever since then, I'm hooked. That being said, here is my favorite
	GIF from one of my favorite Disney movies, UP! 
	</p>

	<p>
	I've worked in customer service for most of my career.  
	I really enjoy meeting new people and helping others, which
	is why I feel that I flourish in a customer focused environment.
	I do my best to put myself in the customers shoes and treat them
	how I would want to be treated if I was needing assistance.  I take 
	my time and listen to what the customer is saying and I do my best to
	correct whatever issue they may have.  I keep a calm and level head
	in potentially stressful situations which helps keep the customers calm
	as well.  I believe all of these qualities are necessary when working
	customers because every day brings a new situation and challenge.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I do believe that the customer is always right.  The customer is the most
	important person to keep happy.  Without customers, there would be no company
	and our jobs wouldn't exist.
	I strongly believe that its important to really listen to what the customer is
	saying.  When I was working in a customer service call center, I received a call
	from a man that was having trouble with his RV refrigerator.  It was almost 2 years
	out of warranty, so unfortunately we couldn't cover the costs.  He was upset that I
	told him that the company wouldn't fix it for free.  I did, however, take time to
	listen to why he was upset, and I apologized.  I also helped him find a repair shop
	that fit his budget.  While I couldn't fix the customers issue 100%, he still left
	our conversation in a happier mood because I took the time to show him that I cared
	about his trouble and that I wanted to help the best I could.

	<h1>Pre-Sales</h1>
	<p>  "I'm considering switching to Product Customizer.  Does your app allow live image previews?"
	</p>
	<p>
	My Response:  Good Afternoon ____,  Thank you so much for contacting ShopStorm.  Unfortunately,
	at the moment we do not offer live image preview.  We do thrive on customer suggestions and feedback
	and I will take your suggestion to my supervisor so that we can hopefully incorporate that feature in the 
	near future.  Here's some of the other great features we do offer, if any should interest you.  Please contact
	me if you have any questions, or any more great suggestions.  We appreciate your time. King Regards.

	<h1>Fire Alarm</h1>
	<a> name = "fire" </a>
	<p>Logging in to see a large number of emails would be very alarming to me.  The first thing I would do would be 
	to open them to see if they're all about similar issues, or if they're different.  If they're similar, I would
	immediately contact the appropriate team to help fix the problem  Then, I would immediately start responding to
	all of the customers either by replying to their emails or by phone  I would ensure them that their problem is 
	getting taken care of as quickly as possible, and thank them for letting us know.  If the emails were all different
	issues, I would get started right away to efficiently clear out the inbox, while making sure the customers are getting
	the help they need.
